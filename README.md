### This repository lists the UIDs of FMO users who have been banned due to violations of the usage policy.

Please refer to blacklist.txt for specific blacklist information and reasons.

If you are on the blacklist and are dissatisfied with the reason for your ban, you may open an issue in this repository.

If you purchased a second-hand device that is on the blacklist, there is no need to open an issue. Please reset the device and email xifengzui@yeah.net to explain the reason and the purchase channel. We will handle it appropriately.

Do not lend your device or callsign to users known to be on the blacklist, as this may result in your callsign and device also facing the risk of being banned.
